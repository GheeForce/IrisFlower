# Iris Flower Dataset
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. [Kaggle IrisFlower]

## Data
Iris Flower DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

The dataset is a CSV file which contains a set of 150 records under 4 features - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and 1 Label Class - Species

## Goal
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and build a predictive model that determines the Iris species based on the 4 features of an Iris Flower.
